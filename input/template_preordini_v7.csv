Sideshow presents the Venomized Hulk Premium Format™ Figure, a massive Marvel collectible melding an incredible hero with an iconic antihero.

This sinister symbiote is only getting stronger! Measuring 24.75 inches (62.8 cm) tall, 23.4 inches (59.4 cm) wide, and 16 inches (40.6 cm) deep, the Venomized Hulk Premium Format™ Figure depicts an alien entity engulfing an Avenger. Bruce Banner's gamma-mutated alter ego fights for control even as Venom's inky tendrils twist his appearance. Hulk's rage and Venom's malevolence manifest in torn clothing, straining muscles, and the symbiote's signature wicked tongue protruding from Hulk's roaring mouth.

The Venomized Hulk Premium Format™ Figure is based on decades of Marvel Comics appearances, highlighting the most awesome aspects of each character within a single fully sculpted statue. With masterful paint and sculpt work, their terrifying transformation is captured in stunning juxtaposition - Hulk dominating the right half and Venom taking over the left. This epic struggle takes place upon a rocky base covered in a swarm of slimy symbiotes. As they ruin the natural environment, so too does Venom wreak havoc on one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

It's your turn to host a monster. Bring home the Venomized Hulk Premium Format™ Figure by Sideshow today!";;;Sideshow Collectibles;Preordini Film e Videogiochi;;;;
