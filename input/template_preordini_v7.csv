Sideshow Marvel Premium Format Gwenom (Statua);920;https://www.heo.com/de/it/product/SS300908;SS300908;747720276185;;"""Okay, boys ... we try it your way ... we speak your language...""

Sideshow presents the Gwenom Premium Format™ Figure, a captivating Marvel collectible showcasing Ghost-Spider's calamitous convergence with the Venom symbiote.

It's a takeover ... and a makeover! The Gwenom Premium Format™ Figure measures 22 inches (55.8 cm) tall, 10.5 inches (26.2 cm) wide, and 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep, striking a stunning juxtaposition between Gwen Stacy's violence and vulnerability. She is corrupted yet empowered as the liquified symbiote merges with her feelings - and fashion sense. Her hood bears salivating fangs like an oversized Venus flytrap, while the slimy symbiote creates a bodysuit and heels for its host. Gwenom's entire sense of self has been warped and distorted through a venomized lens, and she can be seen smirking even as an alien anger consumes her.

Based on Inhyuk Lee's variant cover for King in Black: Gwenom vs. Carnage #1 (2021), the fully sculpted Gwenom Premium Format™ Figure features a vicious antihero engulfing an Earth-65 icon. She raises one clawed hand while Venom's tooth-studded tongue trails down her body toward more inky tendrils below. Gwen stands on a stone-textured base that has also been overrun with symbiotes, emphasizing the inescapable nature of her predicament. Pair this Marvel statue with the Gwenom vs. Carnage Fine Art Print by Inhyuk Lee - sold separately - for the ultimate tribute to this Queen in Black.

It's time to embrace your darkness! Bring home the Gwenom Premium Format™ Figure by Sideshow today.
